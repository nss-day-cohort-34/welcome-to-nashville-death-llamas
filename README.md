# Welcome to Nashville

This single-page Javascript app was created by Matt Ross, Blake Slochowsky, Ellie Ash, and Noah Bartfield. aka The Death Llamas

## A little bit about our app

In this app users can search for four different things to do/visit in Nashville:
* parks -- using the Nashville [Metro Gov API] - Noah Bartfield
* restaurants -- using the [Zomato API] - Blake Slochowsky
* meetups -- using the [Eventbrite API] - Matt Ross
* concerts -- using the [Ticketmaster API] - Ellie Ash

When the user searches for any of the four categories of things to do, the results are listed in the DOM. Each result item has an affordance to add the item to the current itinerary.
